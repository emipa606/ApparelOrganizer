Ever get tired of the clicking you have to do in the apparel menu?

This organizes most apparels in groups:
- Civilian apparel
- Combat apparel
- Special apparel (belts, psyfoil...)
- Custom categories for Star Wars and Tiberium Rim mods

I can&amp;apos;t move some apparel to groups, so it is just dublicated there.
Groups are [bracketed] to make it easy to see.

This patch is safe to add and remove in existing games.
Load this at the end of you mod list.
